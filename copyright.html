      Logo Usage Guidelines

      The logo is released under Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Universal v1.0 (learn more here). Nevertheless, the CSS-Next Community Group decided to provide usage guidelines to make sure the logo is used in an accessible and recognizable manner.

      Font

      The logo uses Dinish Condensed Heavy which is open-source and free to use. The numbers have been slightly adjusted to match the overall logo, therefore we advise you to only use the official logos provided by the CSS Next Community Group inside of this repository to keep the logo recognizable across different sources.

      The “Standard C++ Foundation” name and stylized “C++” logo are trademarks of the Standard C++ Foundation and may not be used without permission from the Foundation. Permission is hereby granted:

      to use the unaltered logo in conjunction with any product (including but not limited to a C++ compiler implementation or tool, or a product written using C++) or material (including but not limited to product packaging, documentation, educational material, user group meeting information, or blog post) that is related to the standardized C++ language or working drafts thereof (including the C++ International Standard and related Technical Specifications, whether published or draft, but excluding nonstandard vendor-specific extensions), and that does not imply endorsement of a product or organization (including but not limited to that it is not being used as part of another organization’s logo); andto use the “Standard C++ Foundation” name to refer to the Standard C++ Foundation or to the isocpp.org website, optionally with a courtesy link to isocpp.org or isocpp.org/about, but not in a way that claims or implies affiliation with or endorsement of a product or organization.

      In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate material related to the portable C++ and its applications, without implicitly endorsing something or someone. We do not normally approve modified versions of the logo; instead, most uses should use the unmodified logo beside or near any other art without overlap. If you would like to inquire about a use that is not covered above, or you are not sure it is covered, please ask first.

      The logo is available in various formats in the C++ logo GitHub repo.

      Trademark Guidelines¶

      Any use of the Go Trademarks other than those permitted in these guidelines must be approved in advance.

      In general, we want the word mark “Go” and the Go Logo to be used freely to refer to the Go programming language.

      We do not want these trademarks to be used:

      - to refer to any other programming language
      - in a way that is misleading or may imply association of unrelated projects, companies, software, documentation, or other resources with the Go programming language project
      - in ways that confuse the community as to whether the Go programming language is open source and free to use.

      These guidelines exist to ensure that the Go programming language can continue to share its releases under open source licenses while making sure that the Go Trademarks are protected as meaningful source identifiers in a way that’s consistent with trademark law.

      Use of the Go Trademarks¶No Authorization Needed¶Nominative Fair Use¶

      In order to accurately identify the Go programming language or any compatible applications, it may be necessary to refer to the language by name (“nominative fair use”). These are the basic rules for nominative fair use of the Go Trademarks:

      - Only use the Go trademark in word mark form, i.e., plain text
      - Do not use the Go Logo or Go as a stylized form without permission
      - Only use the Go trademark as much as is necessary. Use should be limited to matter-of-fact statements
      - Do not use the Go trademark in any way that suggests or implies affiliation with or endorsement from the community or from Google.

      Nominative or descriptive uses in fair use may arise in an educational context or in books or blogs about the Go programming language and any derivative works.

      Java Logo
      <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/java-licensing-logo-guidelines-1908204.pdf"></a>
      In all new productions and printings of your products and related marketing materials, use the logo that correctly 

      represents your product’s qualification, and follow these guidelines. The Java Powered, Java Compatible, and Java 

      Compatible Enterprise Edition licensing logos are intended for use on a physical product and its documentation and 

      packaging, or as a descriptor on a product’s boot-up or information screen. Any use on websites and/or marketing 

      materials must be closely tied with a description of the qualifying product. 

      Unlike the Java Powered, Java Compatible, and Java Compatible Enterprise Edition licensing logos, which indicate product 

      compliance, the Java Licensee logo indicates that a company is licensing Java technology from Oracle and does not convey 

      product compliance. The Java Licensee logo is not to be used on products. Licensees may use the Java Licensee logo on 

      materials such as their corporate website or collateral. 

      These guidelines outline rules for correct presentation of the appropriate logos in a variety of applications and media. In the 

      following examples, Java licensing logos are used interchangeably to illustrate key concepts. These concepts apply to all of 

      the licensing logos, not just the one shown in a given example. Java licensing logos may be used only in accordance with 

      these directives. All other use is prohibited by Oracle.

      Markdown Logo
      <a href="https://github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark/blob/master/LICENSE"></a>
      DEDICATED TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BY DUSTIN CURTIS

To the extent possible under law, Dustin Curtis has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to Markdown Mark.

The Markdown Mark has been dedicated to the public domain. It is protected by the Creative Commons CC0 Universal Public Domain Dedication license. You can read the entire license below or at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en.

CC0 UNIVERSAL PUBLIC DOMAIN DEDICATION LICENSE

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
a. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
b. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
c. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
d. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
e. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
f. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

      Recommendations

Please use the blue TypeScript mark above as the primary logo for TypeScript.

This is the right logo for blog posts, news articles, giveaway stickers and general marketing for yourself.

The “TS” in the logo is white, not transparent by default.

There is a capital “S” in TypeScript, just like in JavaScript.

Please Don't

Use the TypeScript logos for your application/product.

Modify the shape of the logos when used.

Integrate the TypeScript logo into your application's logo.

Name a product which implies TypeScript's endorsement of the product.

      Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.
