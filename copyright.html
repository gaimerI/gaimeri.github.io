      CAN I USE THIS LOGO ON WEB APPLICATIONS BUILT ON HTML5?

      Yes.

      CAN I USE THIS LOGO ON WEB SITES THAT AREN'T BUILT WITH HTML5?

      Yes, if you are talking about or showing your support for HTML5. However, if the site is not built using HTML5, you should of course not use the logo to imply that it is.

      No, this logo does not imply validity or conformance.

      Logo Usage Guidelines

      The logo is released under Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Universal v1.0 (learn more here). Nevertheless, the CSS-Next Community Group decided to provide usage guidelines to make sure the logo is used in an accessible and recognizable manner.

      Font

      The logo uses Dinish Condensed Heavy which is open-source and free to use. The numbers have been slightly adjusted to match the overall logo, therefore we advise you to only use the official logos provided by the CSS Next Community Group inside of this repository to keep the logo recognizable across different sources.
